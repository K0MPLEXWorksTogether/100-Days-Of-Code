# 100 Days Of Code
A simple repo to maintain all the code I wrote during my time at the 100 days of python challenge.

Here's a small summary of all the folders, and the project that has been implemented in them:

- **EtchASketch:** A turtle based program that simulates the functionality of the Etch-A-Sketch toy. 
*Skills Learnt:* The working of higher order functions, by learning about event listeners in turtle.
